To run the application (on XAMPP):
1.) Install xampp and create user credentials for MySQL database
2.) Create appropriate database in MySQL for connection
3.) Install Composer and add it to path environment variable
4.) Using Composer (and following the readme in the laravel folder), install the laravel framework under the htdocs file for XAMPP, which is where the files are hosted locally
5.) Once there (after following the other readme, which explains in a bit more depth), open a browser and type localhost/laravel/public, which should bring you to the default laravel screen with its symbol.  This is how you know it was installed properly
6.) Finally, start coding!
